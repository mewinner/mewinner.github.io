		<p> My name is Mara Winner and I am a Junior here at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease at eight years old, creating an entirely new diet that I was not used to and was unfamiliar back in 2009. Soon after getting diagnosed, my entire household became Gluten Free, with both my sister and my dad also having Celiac as well. This website is about how I have adjusted to a gluten free lifestyle in college, and have found ways to create a healthy and delicious diet as a college student who is always on the go. Throughout this website you will be able to see different restaurants that do well with gluten free, as well as different recipes and snacks I like to make when I'm at home cooking. I hope you enjoy and maybe get hungry along the way:)</p>
